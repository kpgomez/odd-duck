### Reflections and Comments

* After implementing the practice of writing out pseudo-code and a better process for organizing my plan of action, the code itself is becoming easier to write, walk through the logic, and troubleshoot.

* Definitely getting better at writing functions and invoking them. 

* I learned to need to run through several tests before submitting because sometimes I get lucky and won't realize there is a logic error until there is enough run throughs. There is no such thing as GitHub is being glitchy.
